    <p id="info-post"><em>Just look!</em> This mountain was soo big even bigger than the <em><strong>"Mount Everest".</strong></em>  I and my friends went up the mountain. It felt like eternity, but we were not bored. We were excited as never before. When we reached the top, it was one of my favorite travel moments. Because the view was so nice that i can not explain.</p>
